# Magento custom flat export #

Parse a Magento csv products export file & generate a new "flat" one.

I created this script because I needed to export a store's products with mainly bundle products
(same product, different weight) for a (French) marketplace who wanted only simple products, and I didn't want to dive
into the Magento API because sanity.
